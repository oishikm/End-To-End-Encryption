# End-To-End-Encryption

Version 1.0

A client-server program to implement socket programming to satisfy my college microproject requirement.

A server opens up 2 ports for 2 clients to communicate with each other.
The clients use end-to-end encryption, so the server cannot understand their communicated data.

3 batch files are provided to automate 

1. compilation of all source files from `src` directory to `class` direcctory.
2. the process of starting 1 server and 2 clients.
3. deletion of all compiled .class files in `class` folder.
