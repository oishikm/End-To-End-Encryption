# End-To-End-Encryption

Version 1.0

A client-server program to implement socket programming to satisfy my college microproject requirement.

A server opens up 2 ports for 2 clients to communicate with each other.
The clients use end-to-end encryption, so the server cannot understand their communicated data.

3 batch files are provided to automate the following :

1. compilation of all source files from `src` directory into `class` directory - [`compile.bat`](https://github.com/oishikm/End-To-End-Encryption/blob/master/Version%201.0/compile.bat)
2. the process of starting 1 server with ports *3033* and *3034* of *localhost (127.0.0.1)* and 2 clients - [`run.bat`](https://github.com/oishikm/End-To-End-Encryption/blob/master/Version%201.0/run.bat)
3. deletion of all compiled .class files in `class` directory - [`remove-compiled.bat`](https://github.com/oishikm/End-To-End-Encryption/blob/master/Version%201.0/remove-compiled.bat)
